# FileServer
It's simple file server. You can upload and read (download) files from it. 
• To download / read file you just have to go `/file/<file_name>`.
• To upload file you have to use POST method at: `/upload/<file_name>`. (for images you can use dataURL)

You can see an example [here](github.com/Spajciuch/FileServer/blob/main/src/test.ts)
